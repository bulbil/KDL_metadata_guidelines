## Kentucky Digital Library
### Metadata Guidelines
---
7.30.13 / Nabil Kashyap

These guidelines describe the descriptive metadata fields used in the Kentucky Digital Library as well as introduces some of the philosophy and workflow behind its processes. The idea is to create a set of guidelines that is open, transparent and editable and that is easily accessed as either a static document or a web page.

This repository contains all the tools for a sample implementation of such document. A single, version-controlled markdown document can be used to generate a web-based document, snippets of HTML suitable for reuse in other contexts and a static PDF.

#### Ingredients:
- markdown document with a set of metadata guidelines for contributors
- php library for parsing markdown into html
- bootstrap framework (for convenience)
- javascript file for integrating parsed markdown and bootstrap's collapse plugin
